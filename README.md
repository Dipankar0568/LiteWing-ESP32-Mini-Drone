## üîß Build Instructions

1. Solder all components on the **custom PCB**.
2. Connect motors and propellers (see Propeller_Direction.png).
3. Flash the firmware (see below).
4. Connect via ESP-Drone App or Python.

## üì¶ Firmware Flashing

### Option 1: ESP-IDF Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Circuit-Digest/ESP-Drone.git
cd ESP-Drone/Firmware/esp-drone
idf.py menuconfig
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash
